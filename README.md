# Voxel-Game
Minecraft Clone(Prototype) in Unity


This is just a prototype I am working on to get an understanding for fractal perlin noise
I did Some Optimizations by just rendering the upper layer 
For Now I am its just a 100x100 grid 
Note:-  Unity is very powerful

Note To Run this prototype:
Extract The Latest RAR file (Example 4.1)
Run Voxel.exe
ALT+F4 to exit :)
